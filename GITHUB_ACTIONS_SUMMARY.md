# GitHub Actions Summary: Pull Request Workflow

## ✅ **YES! GitHub Actions WILL Check Your Pull Requests**

When you create a pull request to `main` or `develop` branches, GitHub Actions automatically runs comprehensive checks to ensure code quality and compatibility.

## 🚀 **What Happens on Every PR:**

### **1. Full CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)**
**Automatically triggers on ALL pull requests**

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```

**✅ Jobs that run (16 parallel jobs):**
- **Test Matrix** (6 jobs): Tests on Ubuntu/Windows/macOS with Go 1.22-1.25
- **Build Matrix** (5 jobs): Cross-compilation for Linux/Darwin/Windows AMD64/ARM64
- **Dependency Test** (2 jobs): Tests dependency installation on Ubuntu/macOS
- **Security Scan** (1 job): Runs gosec and govulncheck security tools
- **Lint** (1 job): Code linting with golangci-lint
- **Integration Test** (1 job): Full MySQL database integration testing

### **2. Dependency Testing (`dependency-test.yml`)**
**Triggers only when dependency scripts change**

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'scripts/install-dependencies.sh'
      - '.github/workflows/dependency-test.yml'
```

**✅ Additional jobs (15 jobs):**
- Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, latest testing
- Debian 10, 11, 12 containerized testing
- macOS 12, 13, 14 testing
- Go 1.21-1.24 compatibility testing

## 📊 **PR Status Display**

In your GitHub PR, you'll see:

```
🔄 Some checks haven't completed yet
   ✅ CI / test-matrix (ubuntu-latest, 1.23)
   ✅ CI / test-matrix (ubuntu-latest, 1.24)
   ✅ CI / test-matrix (windows-latest, 1.23)
   ✅ CI / test-matrix (macos-latest, 1.23)
   ✅ CI / build-matrix (linux, amd64)
   ✅ CI / build-matrix (linux, arm64)
   ✅ CI / build-matrix (darwin, amd64)
   ✅ CI / build-matrix (darwin, arm64)
   ✅ CI / build-matrix (windows, amd64)
   ✅ CI / dependency-test (ubuntu, macos)
   ✅ CI / security-scan
   ✅ CI / lint
   ✅ CI / integration-test
   ✅ CI / status-check
```

## 🎯 **PR Check Requirements**

**Your PR can only be merged when:**
- ✅ All test-matrix jobs pass (6/6)
- ✅ All build-matrix jobs pass (5/5)
- ✅ Security scan passes
- ✅ Lint check passes
- ✅ Integration test passes
- ✅ Final status check passes

## 🧪 **Test It Locally First**

Before creating a PR, you can run the same checks locally:

```bash
# Quick PR readiness check
make build && make test && make check-deps

# Individual checks (same as CI)
make build          # Build matrix simulation
make test           # Test matrix simulation
make check-deps     # Dependency test simulation
make lint           # Lint simulation (if target exists)
make security       # Security scan simulation (if target exists)

# Test version functionality
./tenangdb version
./tenangdb --help
```

## 🔄 **PR Workflow Timeline**

1. **Create PR** → GitHub immediately starts workflows
2. **~2 minutes** → Initial jobs start (lint, security)
3. **~5 minutes** → Build jobs complete
4. **~10 minutes** → Test jobs complete
5. **~15 minutes** → Integration tests complete
6. **~20 minutes** → All checks finished, PR ready to merge

## 🚨 **If Checks Fail**

**You'll see red X marks:**
```
❌ CI / test-matrix (ubuntu-latest, 1.23)
❌ CI / build-matrix (linux, amd64)
❌ CI / security-scan
```

**How to fix:**
1. Click on the failed job to see error details
2. Fix the issue in your code
3. Commit and push the fix
4. GitHub automatically re-runs the checks

## 📋 **Example PR Scenarios**

### **Regular Code Change**
```
Files: internal/backup/service.go
Workflows: ci.yml only
Jobs: 16 jobs
Duration: ~15 minutes
```

### **Dependency Script Change**
```
Files: scripts/install-dependencies.sh
Workflows: ci.yml + dependency-test.yml
Jobs: 31 jobs
Duration: ~25 minutes
```

### **Documentation Only**
```
Files: README.md
Workflows: ci.yml only
Jobs: 16 jobs (fast execution)
Duration: ~10 minutes
```

## 🎉 **Benefits of PR Checks**

- **🔒 Quality Assurance**: No broken code reaches main branch
- **🌐 Cross-Platform**: Ensures compatibility across all OS/architectures
- **🛡️ Security**: Automatic vulnerability scanning
- **🧹 Code Quality**: Consistent code style and best practices
- **⚡ Early Detection**: Catch issues before they become problems
- **📊 Confidence**: Merge with confidence knowing all tests pass

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Test locally first** to avoid CI failures
2. **Keep PRs small** for faster CI execution
3. **Fix failures quickly** to unblock reviews
4. **Watch the Actions tab** for detailed logs
5. **Use draft PRs** for work-in-progress (checks still run)

## 🔧 **Customization**

You can customize which checks run by:
- Modifying workflow trigger conditions
- Adding/removing jobs from the matrix
- Adjusting timeout values
- Adding new test scenarios
